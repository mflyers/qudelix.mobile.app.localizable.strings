[Trouble Shooting]

If you can't connect your 5K with the app, please follow the steps below.

1. Remove all devices from the system Bluetooth paired device list

Always remember that heat is the number one enemy of LiPo batteries. The hotter your batteries get, the shorter their lifespan will be.

Do not leave the battery in a hot temperature environment. Especially for the use case with car aux-in, do not leave the 5K in a car.  If the car is parked in the sun, the average temperature inside rises. It could reach nearly 120 ~160 degrees Fahrenheit. It would kill not only the battery life but also cause the battery in serious FIRE HAZARD.

Please use 5V(1~2A) standard charger or PC USB port only for charging 5K. There are many fast chargers and USB-C 9V chargers that don't pass through any safety certifications. Those would cause permanent damage to the unit.

Please note that, if improperly used, Rechargeable Lithium-ion polymer batteries are potentially hazardous and can present a severe FIRE HAZARD, SERIOUS INJURY, and PROPERTY DAMAGE.

"5K Absolute Volume Control offers 2-way associative control for optimal sound quality. It always keeps and guarantees the full precision audio stream over Bluetooth or USB. In either way, via smartphone source volume or 5K device volume, you can control the loudness level without any loss. It is highly recommended to turn on the Absolute Volume for the best sound quality.

The 5K provides a higher output power than other portable audio devices. An accidental volume up may damage your ear and IEMs. For high sensitivity IEMs, we strongly recommend limiting the device volume.

The Volume Protection works when two source devices have different source volume level. When you switch the audio source, 5K check the volume differences and adjust the volume the device volume if the level is too louder than the previous level.


[IMPORTANT]

Unlike PC USB and iOS USB(through Camera Kit), Android USB Audio doesn't support the Absolute Volume Control. The Android Source Volume scales down the PCM sample as the volume gets lowered. For the best sound quality with Android USB Audio, you will need to keep the source volume at maximum.

And due to the above reason, the Volume Protection may not work as intended when switching audio between Android USB and Bluetooth.";

STANDARD provides the best trade-off for battery time and sound quality, while PERFORMANCE does the best sound quality with lesser battery time.

USB connection to the device overrides the current profile and switches it to PERFORMANCE temporarily.

NORMAL and HIGH mode set the ES9218p maximum output level as 1VRMS and 2VRMS, respectively. To prevent sudden amplification, the FW is designed to compensate the volume level, upon 1V and 2V HPAMP Gain change. You will experience no difference in loudness when switching the mode to 2VRMS, but you will have the max volume extended by +6dB.

2VRMS, with higher HPAMP gain, produces a little higher background noise and consumes more battery time. Both 1V and 2V mode provides the same sonic performance. There's no reason to use 2VRMS for high sensitivity IEMs or Headphones.

For high sensitivity IEMS, PERFORMANCE + 1VRMS provides the lowest background noise floor. For the best sound quality, you will need to set the source and device volume as we recommend.";
